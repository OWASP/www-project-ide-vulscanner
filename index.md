![IDE-VulScanner](/assets/images/pluginIcon.png) OWASP IDE-VulScanner is an open source IDE plugin tool to analyze an applicationâ€™s components. It is built on top of [OWASP Dependency Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/), which scans your application's component vulnerabilities during implementation phase.

### Features
* Vulnerability code scan during implementation phase
* Save security patch & maintenance costs
* Low overall high & critical vulnerabilities counts

### How it works
* Tool uses [OWASP Dependency Check](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-check/), which is a software compisition analysis (SCA) tool
* Any third party dependency used within code can be analyzed from a developer's IDE. This would prevent overall code from a potential security risk
* Plugins supporting common IDEs i.e. eclipse, IntelliJ, vscode are easy to install. Gives a developer a comprehensive view of all the vulnerable dependencies used within code with recommended fix
